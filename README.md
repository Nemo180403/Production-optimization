# Production-optimization
Production optimization by optimizing fracture length, dewatering efficiency or bottom hole pressure.
Problem Statement:  

In deeper wells early gas breakout confirms the having good gas content, good gas saturation recorded in core well. But the production rate fails to sustain due to lower permeability (0.5- 2 mD)

Possible solution for increase in optimum production:  Increasing effective reservoir drainage
Optimization of well spacing
Maximize the reservoir contact area
a.) Increase in fracture length in vertical-deviated wells â€“ 
   1. In higher permeability region, impact of frac length  on productivity is relatively limited. As the permeability 
      decreases the half frac length becomes crucial for sustainable production
    2. Focus on maximizing propped length 
b.) Horizontal well/ Multilateral wells
